These partnerships foster more comprehensive measurements, robust datasets, and cost-effective missions.</p><p>The European Space Agency (ESA), Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) have combined their resources, technical knowledge, and expertise to produce this Earth Observing Dashboard, which strengthens our global understanding of the changing environment with human activity.</p><p>The dashboard provides an easy-to-use resource for all kinds of public from the scientist to the decision-maker, including people not familiar with satellites. Based on accurate remote sensing observations, it helps to illustrate changes affecting Earth’s air, land, or water, and offers a precise, objective and factual view without any artifacts of our planet. You can explore countries and regions around the world to see how the indicators in specific locations changed over time.</p><p>Supported by the rich information provided by the EO data, the dashboard provides interactive narratives addressing societally relevant topics, such as the importance of forests in the climate system, accelerating melting in the Arctic, or processes occurring in the oceans. ESA, JAXA, and NASA will continue to enhance this dashboard as new data becomes available.</p><h2 id="open-for-community-contributions-with-eo-mission-data" tabindex="-1">Open for community contributions with EO mission data <a class="header-anchor" href="#open-for-community-contributions-with-eo-mission-data" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Open for community contributions with EO mission data&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Using a storytelling approach, the Dashboard combines interactive visual elements—such as maps, indicators, and dynamic charts—to explore the impacts of global events on our planet. These stories make complex data more accessible and engaging, allowing users to connect with the science in a meaningful way.</p><p>Each story draws on a curated set of indicators derived from Earth observation data, providing context and evidence for real-world phenomena. For those who want to go deeper, the Dashboard enables direct exploration of the underlying datasets, fostering transparency and discovery.</p><p>The platform is built with <a href="https://eodash.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">open-source software</a> and offers simple and accessible <a href="https://eox-a.github.io/EOxElements/?path=/story/elements-eox-storytelling--markdown-with-editor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">tools</a> to allow community contributions so that <strong>anyone can create and publish their own stories using EO Dashboard data</strong>.</p><p><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23ddfd5d-d8cd-4497-a489-5c07a90d9d39" alt="Screenshot 2025-06-18 at 19 13 38"></p><p><strong>Contact</strong>: <a href="mailto:eodash@esa.int" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">eodash@esa.int</a></p>',11)]))}const u=a(s,[["render",i]]);export{m as __pageData,u as default};
