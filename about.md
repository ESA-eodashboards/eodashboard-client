# About 

International collaboration among space agencies is central to the success of satellite Earth observations and data analysis, aiming at providing an accurate and timely information to decision-makers, main stakeholders and public. These partnerships foster more comprehensive measurements, robust datasets, and cost-effective missions.

The European Space Agency (ESA), Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) have combined their resources, technical knowledge, and expertise to produce this Earth Observing Dashboard, which strengthens our global understanding of the changing environment with human activity.

The dashboard provides an easy-to-use resource for all kinds of public from the scientist to the decision-maker, including people not familiar with satellites. Based on accurate remote sensing observations, it helps to illustrate changes affecting Earthâ€™s air, land, or water, and offers a precise, objective and factual view without any artifacts of our planet. You can explore countries and regions around the world to see how the indicators in specific locations changed over time.

Supported by the rich information provided by the EO data, the dashboard provides interactive narratives addressing societally relevant topics, such as the importance of forests in the climate system, accelerating melting in the Arctic, or processes occurring in the oceans.
ESA, JAXA, and NASA will continue to enhance this dashboard as new data becomes available.
